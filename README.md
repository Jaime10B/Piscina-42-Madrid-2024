These are my implementations of all the solutions for some of the exercises in the Piscine 42 that I was on July 2024. 

All exercises I have uploaded from every project are succesfully passed by moulinette except from C04 exercise 5 ft_atoi_base.c that works properly but there might be something to change, and the rush01 that is incomplete.

In order to pass C08, you will need to do at least one more exercise, only with 3 is not enough to pass over 50%.

If you are reading this, good luck in your own piscine, I'm sure you need it. ;) No one knows the criteria to get selected afterwards so just program, socialize a lot, be respectful and don't forget to rest.
